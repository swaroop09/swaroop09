Hi there, I'm Swaroop Ninewar 👋 I'm passionate about AI/Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP and Generative AI.

I love exploring how AI can solve real-world problems and create new possibilities. Always excited to learn and share cool projects!

👨‍🎓🙋‍♂️ About Me 💼🎒: 🔭 I hold a Masters Degree in Data Science And Analytics from University of Hertfordshire and I've 2+ years of experience building and deploying machine learning and deep learning models.

I have a strong practical and theoretical experience in the development of Machine Learning Models and Generative AI.

🔭 I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Below are some used models:

Linear Regression Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines (SVM) Decision Trees (DT) Random Forests (RF) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Deep Neural Networks Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Naive Bayes (NB) Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) XGBoost Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 🔭 Below are some state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series forecasting models used in various real-time projects:

🔭 Furthermore, below are some of the tools used during my experience for Generative AI:

Langchain LangGraph Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Llama Index OpenAI API Mixtral (LLM) Llama 2 (LLM) GPT - 3 (LLM) GPT - 3.5 (LLM) GPT - 4 (LLM)
